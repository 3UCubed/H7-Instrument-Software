# H7-Instrument-Software

## Overview

This project is the **Instrument firmware** for an STM32H753-based system that handles and transmits data for **Housekeeping (HK)**, **PMT (Photomultiplier Tube)**, and **ERPA**. It performs real-time acquisition, processing, and transmission over UART (interrupt/DMA driven), and controls multiple power rails and generators. The firmware runs under **FreeRTOS** and supports a BootManager-based update flow.

## Features

- **Data Sampling**: Collects, processes, and packets HK/PMT/ERPA data.
- **Real-Time Communication**: UART TX/RX via interrupts/DMA for robust streaming.
- **Power Management**: Enter/exit STOP mode and orderly rail control.
- **Error Handling**: ECC callbacks, reset-cause capture, counters, and reporting.
- **Synchronization & Modes**: Sync/Science/Idle mode flags with deterministic timers.
- **Boot/Update Support**: Ground command to enter the ST ROM bootloader via BootManager.

## Components

- **Microcontroller**: STM32H753 (Cortex-M7)
- **Peripherals**: ADC1/ADC3, DAC1 (DMA), SPI1/SPI2, I2C1, USART1, TIM1/TIM2/TIM3, RTC, IWDG1, RAMECC, DMA, GPIO
- **RTOS**: FreeRTOS for task scheduling and inter-task signaling (event flags)

## Functionality

### Sampling Functions

- **`sample_pmt()`**: Samples PMT (SPI/uptime) and sends a PMT packet.
- **`sample_erpa()`**: Samples ERPA (SPI/ADC/uptime) and sends an ERPA packet.
- **`sample_hk()`**: Samples housekeeping (sensors/I2C rails/etc.) and sends an HK packet.

### Communication

- **`UART_TX_init(void *argument)`**: TX task pulls from the queue and transmits via UART (DMA/interrupts).

### Power Management

- **`enter_stop()`**: Suspends RTOS tasks, enters STOP mode, and resumes via clean reset path.

### Synchronization & Modes

- **`sync()`** (if used): Coordinates with external system timing and RTC.
- **Mode flags** (SYNC, SCIENCE, IDLE) drive which packet producers/timers are active.

## Boot & Update (How the App Works with BootManager)

- **BootManager** at `0x08000000` validates the application at `0x08020000` and chain-loads it when valid; otherwise it jumps to the **STM32 ROM Bootloader** at `0x1FF09800`.
- In the **Instrument App**, sending **`CMD_UPDATE_FIRMWARE (0x2A)`** sets a RAM flag and resets the MCU. On the next boot, **BootManager** detects the flag and immediately jumps to the ROM bootloader for flashing.
- **`CMD_ST_BL_SYNC (0x7F)`** returns an immediate `0x79` ACK to help ground tools verify the link before switching into the ST bootloader workflow.

## Error Handling

Use the projectâ€™s error framework to capture and report faults:

- **ECC Callbacks**: `HAL_FLASHEx_EccCorrectionCallback()` / `HAL_FLASHEx_EccDetectionCallback()`
- **Reset Cause**: `get_reset_cause()` records IWDG/BOR events
- **Central Handler**: `Error_Handler()` increments counters and logs/reporting

## Dependencies

- STM32 HAL (H7)
- FreeRTOS
